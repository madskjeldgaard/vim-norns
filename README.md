# vim-norns
![norns in action](norns-in-action.jpg)

A nvim plugin for working remotely with the monome [norns platform](https://monome.org/docs/norns/). It makes use of the websocketed REPL available in [maiden](https://monome.org/docs/norns/maiden/) and a bunch of nice unix tools to make communication between norns and host computer super easy. 

When working on projects, it works by syncing a local folder on your computer to an equivalent folder on the norns and allowing you to execute code remotely.

It also has features to make it easy to work with the norns file system from your host computer. From within vim you can ssh into the norns, you can easily download files from it to your host computer etcetera.

Heavily inspired by  simonvanderveldt's work in atom:

## Installation

Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):
`Plug 'madskjeldgaard/vim-norns'`

## Requirements
This plugin was aimed at use with linux but will work with MacOS as well if you can get the required external dependencies installed.

### Dependencies
* NVIM
* rlwrap
* websocat
* sshpass
* rsync

Optional but recommended:
* Fzf / vim-fzf

### Installing dependencies

#### Install on Arch Linux:
`yay -S rlwrap websocat sshpass rsync fzf`

#### Install on MacOS with homebrew (untested):
`brew install rlwrap websocat rsync fzf`

There is no official package for sshpass in brew at the moment, but this may work:
`brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadwanev/bigboybrew/master/Library/Formula/sshpass.rb`

## Usage

### Help
See `:h norns` for more information on usage.

### IP
The plugin expect norns to be on your local network as `norns.local` but this can be overwritten by setting the variable `g:norns_ip` to something else, like: 

`let g:norns_ip="192.168.0.70"`

The plugin comes with a helper function to aid in doing this: `:NornsFind`. This will display a list of all ip addresses on your network and by choosing one of these, the variable is set.

### SSH Password
The plugin uses the ssh password `sleep` by default to log into the norns.

This can be changed by setting a variable:
`let g:norns_ssh_pass="nosleep"`
