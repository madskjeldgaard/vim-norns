# vim-norns
![norns in action](norns-in-action.jpg)

A rough (and work in progress) plugin for working remotely on scripts/projects for the monome [norns platform](https://monome.org/docs/norns/). It makes use of the websocketed REPL available in [maiden](https://monome.org/docs/norns/maiden/)

Heavily inspired by  simonvanderveldt's work in atom:
https://github.com/monome/norns/issues/1067

And David Granst√∂m's scnvim:
github.com/davidgranstrom/scnvim

## Dependencies
Unfortunately, this plugin has a lot of dependencies:

- rlwrap
- websocat
- sshpass
- rsync

Fortunately, if you are on Arch Linux or Manjaro, they are easy to install using yay: 
`yay -S rlwrap websocat sshpass rsync`
